### Current Projects

#### 1. FD-GAN: A Dual-Domain Approach with Fourier Domain Discriminators for Denoising Low-Dose CT Images (Poster Presentation Outstanding Award Winner at SRD 2025, Wenzhou-Kean University)
- **Introduction**: This project addresses the challenge of denoising low-dose CT (LDCT) images, aiming to minimize radiation exposure while preserving diagnostic accuracy. It proposes a novel dual-domain GAN model, FD-GAN, that leverages both spatial and Fourier domains to enhance detail recovery and training stability.
- **Key Technologies**:
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - U-Net Discriminators in Image & Fourier Domains
  - Fourier Transform-Based Losses
  - PyTorch Deep Learning Framework
- **Data Source**: NIHAAPM-Mayo Clinic Low-Dose CT Dataset (2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge)
- **Research Outcomes**:
  - Developed a novel FD-GAN framework with dual-domain discriminators
  - Achieved superior denoising performance with improved PSNR and SSIM on both Chest-10% and Head-25% datasets
  - Outperformed state-of-the-art MSE-based (e.g., RED-CNN) and GAN-based (e.g., DU-GAN, WGAN-VGG) models in both visual and quantitative evaluations
  - Demonstrated effectiveness of dual-domain learning through comprehensive ablation studies

This paper has been accepted to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025. [Click here to see the paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org).


#### 2. Enhancing Portfolio Optimization with Data Fusion and Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance (Outstanding Research Award Winner at SRD 2024, Wenzhou-Kean University)
- **Introduction**: This project aims to revolutionize portfolio optimization in quantitative finance by integrating advanced machine learning techniques and data fusion methodologies.
- **Key Technologies**:
  - Machine Learning Models (LSTM, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
  - Qlib Library
  - Data Fusion Methods
- **Data Source**: CSMAR (China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database)
- **Research Outcomes**: 
  - Successfully reproduced three machine learning models
  - Validated each model with 50 iterations
  - Established a comprehensive portfolio optimization framework
